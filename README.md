# Elections
I've been trying to collect county-level presidential election results in one place. County, State, and National Level results from 2000-2012 can be found in the [data/csv](https://github.com/jladams/elections/tree/master/data/csv) directory.

Data sources used so far:  
[2000](http://www.american.edu/spa/ccps/Data-Sets.cfm)  
[2004](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2004-presidential-general-election-county-results-direct-download)  
[2008](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2008-presidential-general-election-county-results-direct-download)  
[2012](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/presidential-general-election-results-2012-direct-download)
